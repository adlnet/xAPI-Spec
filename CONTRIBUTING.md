### Historical Contributors
In collection of requirements for the Experience API, many people and
organizations provided invaluable feedback to the SCORM, distributed learning efforts, and learning technology
efforts in general.  While not an exhaustive listing, the white papers gathered
in 2008 by the Learning Education and Training Standards Interoperability (LETSI)
group, the Rustici Software UserVoice website, one-on-one interviews and various
blogs were important sources from which requirements were gathered for the
Experience API specification.

#### ADL's Role in the Experience API
The Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative has taken on the roles of steward and facilitator
in the development of the Experience API.  The Experience API is seen as one piece of the ADL Training
and Learning Architecture, which facilitates learning anytime and anywhere. ADL views the Experience API
as an evolved version of Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) that can support similar use cases,
but can also support many of the use cases gathered by ADL and submitted by those involved in distributed
learning that SCORM could not enable.

##How to Contribute

This document outlines various ways of contributing to the specification:

* [Reviewing open Pull Requests](#review-pr)
* [Suggesting solutions to issues](#suggest-solution)
* [Making a Pull Request to address an issue](#make-pr)

<a name='review-pr'/>
### Review a Pull Request (PR)
The most helpful **and** easiest way to contribute to the specification is to review an existing PR. You can find a
[list of open PRs here](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/pulls). To review a PR you should:

* Read any issues linked to from the PR description and make sure you understand the issue the PR is designed to address.
* Read any comments on both the issues and the PR to understand if the goals of the original issue have changed and if
any solutions have been agreed.
* Read the relevant sections in the [development version](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/1.0.3/xAPI.md) of the specification.
* Check the 'Files changed' tab of the PR and look at what has changed. Use the 'rich diff' option if that helps you to see
the changes better. Check to see if what's been changed matches the solution you expected from reading the issue and comments.
* Look for problems such as typos, unintended changes to behaviour and any text that's unclear.
* Check that anything that's been removed has either been replaced or the removal was intentional (based on reading the issue
and comments).
* Check that the [Style Guide](#style-guide) has been followed.
* If you spot any issues with the PR, add a comment describing these problems as best you can and suggesting how they can
be resolved.
* If the PR looks good to you, add a comment saying "+1".
* If you are unsure about the PR or have questions, ask questions in the PR comments.
* If you feel that the PR should never be merged, even with changes, add a comment starting with "-1" and explaining your
reasons. If your comments run contrary to what's already been agreed in the issues, there might be some resistance, but that's ok
if you have a strong argument!

When reviewing a PR please don't:

* Review and leave no comment; always let us know you've had a look!
* Suggest additional changes outside of what the PR was intended to achieve.
[Raise a separate issue](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/issues/new) for additional changes.
* Make vague criticisms without suggesting the changes to the PR that would meet those criticisms.

<a name='suggest-solution'/>
### Suggest a solution
The second most helpful and second easiest way to contribute to the specification is to suggest a solution to an issue that has been raised.
Ideally the person who raises the issue will propose a solution, but this does not always happen and you may be able to improve a suggestion.

To suggest a solution to an issue you should:

* Read the issue and ensure you understand the problem being described. Ask questions if you need to.
* Read the relevant sections in the [development version](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/1.0.3/xAPI.md) of the specification.
* Add a comment stating:
    * Which sections of the specification you propose to change.
    * A description of the proposed change.
    * Any reasons for and against the change you're proposing.

Once your suggestion has been discussed and agreed, add another comment summarising your understanding of the outcome of the discussion and
including proposed wording for the changes you've suggested.

Good and detailed suggested solutions for issues make it much easier to write PRa and helps to ensure those PRs are merged faster.

<a name='make-pr'/>
### Make a Pull Request (PR)
The hardest way of directly contributing to the specification is to make Pull Requests and the xAPI Working Group recommends only getting involved in
this way if you are already used to Github and markdown and/or have previously contributed to reviewing PRs and suggesting solutions to issues.

Before making a PR you should:
* Read the issue you are planning to address carefully including any comments.
* Read the relevant sections in the [development version](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/1.0.3/xAPI.md) of the specification.
* Read any suggested solutions to the issue and the discussion around those issues.

If you would like to raise a PR that directly addresses your own concern, there is no need to raise a separate issue.

To make a PR you will need to edit xAPI.md either using the GitHub.com interface, or use git on your local computer.
The GitHub.com interface is simpler for new users and is ideal for smaller changes like typos. These two methods are described below.

When making a PR, you should include a description that explains:
* What issue numbers of any issues you are addressing (normally just one issue)?
* How does your PR relate to any proposed solutions to the issue?
* If you have moved sections, have you made any changes to content within those moved sections?
* What decisions did you make in writing the change? Why did you make those decisions?

#### Edit on GitHub.com
To edit the specification on GitHub.com, first open the [development version](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/1.0.3/xAPI.md)
of the specification, then [follow the instructions here](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/).

#### Edit Locally

##### Set up
If you are not currently working with GitHub and git, follow these set up steps
first. GitHub provides excellent help at [https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)

##### Fork the ADL repository
Go to the Experience API repository. Fork the repository to your own account using
the "Fork" button on the top right of Experience API repository page. This makes a
copy of the Experience API repository. This fork gives you the ability to edit your
version of the document without impacting the master copy.

##### Install Git (use cmd line) or Install Windows/Mac GitHub client
You need to install Git to work with a GitHub repository. If you are on a Windows machine,
you can download the GitHub client app. If you use a Mac you can download the GitHub client app
but will also have to download git to add a remote to the master repository. Otherwise install git from the
git site.

__Git__
This provides a command line client app for working with a git repository (like
GitHub)
Download and run [git install](http://git-scm.com/downloads)

__GitHub Client__
GitHub Client provides a GUI interface to simplify working with a repository on
GitHub. This does not currently support synchronizing with a master repository so
some commands will still need to be completed using the command line.

__Mac:__ http://mac.github.com/
__Windows:__ http://windows.github.com/


##### Clone your GitHub fork to your machine
To make edits and work on the files in the repository, clone your repository to
your local machine using Git. The url is provided on the home page of your
repository (ex. `https://github.com/<your username>/xAPI-Spec/`)

__Git__
`git clone https://github.com/<your username>/xAPI-Spec/>`

__GitHub Client__
On the home screen of the client app, select your account under 'github' and
choose the repository you want to clone. Selecting the repository from the list
gives you an option to clone it.

##### Add ADL repository as upstream remote
Add a remote repository to git to reference the master repository. This will make
synchronizing with the master repository a bit easier.

__Git__
`git remote add upstream https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec`

__GitHub Client__
Currently the GitHub clients don't have a way to synchronize with the master
repository. In order to do this, open your repository on the GitHub client
app home screen. On the repository screen select 'tools' and 'open a shell
here'. Alternatively use the 'Git Shell' shortcut if it was created during
installation. **NOTE:** If you're using a Mac there is no shell shortcut so
navigate to `/your/repo/path/xAPI-Spec` then follow the shell instructions.

In the shell, enter..
`git remote add upstream https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec`


#### Workflow

##### Sync up with ADL Repository development
Pull down changes from the development repository. This automatically does a
fetch of the repository and a merge into your local repository. Currently
the development version of the spec is 1.0.3.

__Git and GitHub Client__
`git pull upstream 1.0.3`

##### Make Changes Locally
Edit the local copy of the file, save and commit. Rule of thumb: Use commits
like save points. Commit to indicate logical groups of edits, and places
where the edits could be safely rolled back.

__Git__
`git commit -a -m "<commit message>"`

__GitHub Client__
The GitHub client will detect saved changes to the documents in your
local repository and present a button to commit your edits at the top
right of the repository screen.

##### Push Changes to Your Repository (Origin)
Pushing your changes to your remote GitHub repository stages the files
so that you can then make requests to the master repository to merge in
your changes.

__Git__
`git push origin`

__GitHub Client__
The GitHub client has a 'sync' button at the top of the repository screen.
This will synchronize your local and remote (origin) repository.

##### Submit a Pull Request to Master ADL Repository (Upstream)
When you forked from the Experience API repository, a link back to the master
repository is remembered. To send your changes back the the master repository,
click the "Pull Request" button at the top of your repository page. This will
direct you to a page that gives you the ability to submit a request to the
master repository to merge in the changes you committed.

<a name='style-guide'/>
##Style Guide
### Expected Values

If a specific data format and value are to be used, the `code` style should be used to denote this.

For example:

    A list of item ids is delimited by `[,]`

And

    The value returned must be `false`.

### Property and object names

When referring to a property, parameter or object, but not specifically calling it out as property, parameter, or object
the name should be capitalized. No formatting or quotes should be used.

For example:

    Context Activities within the Context of the Statement are awesome.

When a specific type is called out, Double quotes should be used (e.g. properties, parameters, and objects). When used within quotes, the capitalization should match that actually used in the object being described.

For example:

    You can use "category" Context Activities to denote the recipe being followed in crafting the statement.

And

    The "member" property is an unordered list!

When a value is expected or described within plain text, but isn't specifically code, single quotes should be used.
In situations where it is important to group text to be specific to the concept, single quotes should also be used.
Single quotes are also allowable if the text would be unclear due to certain property names.  Basically, single quotes
are the catch-all for any case where not having any clarifying punctuation or style would cause confusion.

For example:

    The reserved Verb 'http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/voided' is an exception.

And

    These additional properties are called ‘interaction component lists’

And

    The Score Object SHOULD include 'scaled'

And

    The 'binary' value should be used.

### Headings
Hashes (#) should be used for all headings following the following format:

# Experience API (1 hash)
## 1 Statement (2 hashes)
### 1.1 Top level property (3 hashes)
#### 1.1.1 next level (4 hashes)
##### 1.1.1.1 next level and any deeper levels (5 hashes)
###### Rationale, details etc. (6 hashes)
