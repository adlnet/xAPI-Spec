# Part Two: Experience API Data

## 1.0 Documents

The Experience API provides a facility for Learning Record Providers to save arbitrary data in the form of documents.  This data 
is largely unstructured, which allows for flexibility.  Specifics on document behaviors can be found in [Part 3](./xAPI-Communication.md#doctransfer) 


## 2.0 Statements  

### 2.1 Purpose

Statements are the evidence for any sort of experience or event which is to be tracked in xAPI. 
While Statements follow a machine readable JSON format, they can also easily be described
using natural language. This can be extremely useful for the design process. Statements are 
meant to be aggregated and analyzed to provide larger meaning for the overall experience than 
just the sum of its parts.

### 2.2 Formatting Requirements

###### Details

All of the properties used in Statements are restricted to certain data types. For clarity, key requirements are 
documented here, emphasizing where xAPI components have a responsibility to act in certain ways to be considered 
conformant to this specification.

###### Requirements

* Statements and other objects SHOULD NOT include properties with a value of an empty object. 
* A Statement MUST use each property no more than one time.
* A Statement MUST use "actor", "verb", and "object".
* A Statement MAY use its properties in any order.
* The LRS MUST NOT return a different serialization of any properties except those 
[listed as exceptions](#231-statement-immutability).

###### Learning Record Provider Requirements

The following requirements reiterate especially important requirements already included elsewhere, to emphasize,
clarify, and provide implementation guidance.  Some types of validation, such as complete IRI validation and validation 
that properties appear only once, are extremely difficult, so much of the burden 
for ensuring data portability is on the Learning Record Provider.

* Values requiring IRIs MUST be sent with valid IRIs. 
* Keys of language maps MUST be sent with valid [RFC 5646](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646) 
language tags, for similar reasons.
* A library SHOULD be used to construct IRIs, as opposed to string concatenation. 
* Values SHOULD be considered to be case sensitive unless specified otherwise. 
* Lowercase SHOULD be used to send case insensitive data.
* Additional properties SHOULD* NOT be added to Statements unless explicitly allowed by this specification. 
* A property SHOULD not occur multiple times in an object. If properties are used multiple times 
within an object, the behavior of the LRS is undefined; it is expected that most LRSs will use existing JSON parsing 
functionality of whichever code languages they use. 

__Note:__ The LRS is recommended to reject Statements containing additional properties. Additional properties in 
Statements would mean that the Statement would not be interoperable with all LRSs. 

###### LRS Requirements

* The LRS MUST reject Statements
    * with any null values (except inside extensions).
    * where the wrong data type is used, for example: 
        * with strings where numbers are required, even if those strings contain numbers, or 
        * with strings where booleans are required, even if those strings contain booleans.
    * with any non-format-following key or value, including the empty string, where a
      string with a particular format (such as mailto IRI, UUID, or IRI) is required.
    * where the case of a key does not match the case specified in this specification.
    * where the case of a value restricted to enumerated values does not match
      an enumerated value given in this specification exactly.
    * where a key or value is not allowed by this specification.
    * containing IRL or IRI values without a scheme.
* The LRS MUST at least validate that the sequence of token lengths for language map keys
matches the [RFC 5646](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646) standard.
* The LRS MUST process and store numbers with at least the precision of IEEE 754 32-bit
floating point numbers.
* The LRS MUST validate parameter values to the same standards required for values of the
same types in Statements. __Note:__ string parameter values are not quoted as they are in JSON.
* The LRS SHOULD treat all values as case sensitive unless specified otherwise.
* The LRS MAY use best-effort validation for IRL and IRI formats to satisfy the
non-format-following rejection requirement.
* The LRS MAY use best-effort validation for language map keys to satisfy the
non-format-following rejection requirement.
* Additional properties SHOULD* NOT be added to Statements and other objects unless explicitly 
allowed by this specification and the LRS SHOULD* reject Statements containing such additional properties.


### 2.3 Statement Lifecycle

Statements are information about a tracked learning experience. Typically, the information represented in the 
Statement has already happened. Thus, the natural language used in "display" or in the human-readable portion of 
the Verb id will usually use the past tense.

Statements are expected to be permanent. The only way to undo a Statement within this specification is to 
[void it](#232-voiding). Voiding does not destroy a Statement, rather indicates the evidence in the Statement is to be disregarded.


#### 2.3.1 Statement Immutability

Statements are immutable (they cannot be changed). The following are exceptions or areas not covered by this rule:

* Potential or required assignments of properties during LRS processing 
("id", "authority", "stored", "timestamp", "version"). 

* Activity Definitions referenced by a Statement. The content of Activity Definitions that are 
referenced in Statements is not considered part of the Statement itself. This means a deep serialization of a Statement 
into JSON will change if the referenced Activity Definition changes (see the [Statement Resource's](./xAPI-Communication.md#21-statement-resource) "format" 
parameter for details).  

* Verbs referenced by a Statement. The "display" property of the Verb is not considered 
part of the Statement itself (see the [Statement Resource's](./xAPI-Communication.md#21-statement-resource) "format" parameter for details). 

* Serialization of Timestamp data. This is not considered part of the immutable Statement itself. 
For example, the "timestamp" and "stored" properties of a Statement can be returned in a different timezone to the one with 
which they were stored so long as the point in time referenced is not affected. 
See [2.4.7 Timestamp](#247-timestamp) and [2.4.8 Stored](#248-stored) for details. 

* Serialization of un-ordered lists. The list of Agents in a Group is not considered to be an ordered 
list.  Thus, the LRS can return this list of Agents in any order. See [Groups](#2422-when-the-actor-objecttype-is-group).

* Attachments. These are not part of Statements and an LRS will return Statements without 
Attachments when a Client requests them (see the [Statement Resource's](./xAPI-Communication.md#21-statement-resource) "attachments" parameter for details).

* Case sensitivity. Some properties are case insensitive and changes in case therefore do not affect 
immutability. For example, the domain portion an e-mail address is case insensitive. It is recommended to use lowercase 
for any case insensitive text. 

The following explicitly are **not** exceptions and **are** covered by this rule:

* Result Duration. Due to variable lengths of months, years and even minutes and the flexible nature of the 
"timestamp" property as representing either the start, middle or end of the experience, it is not possible for 
an LRS to accurately deserialize the Result Duration and convert between units of time. For this reason, the 
Result Duration is considered a string for purposes of Statement comparison. 

###### Statement Comparision Requirements
There are a number of scenarios outlined in this specification which require Statements to be
compared to see if they match. In these scenarios, the following rules apply:

* Differences which could have been caused by 
[exceptions to Statement immutability](#231-statement-immutability) MUST be ignored.
* Differences relating to a different serialization of any properties not
[listed as exceptions](#231-statement-immutability) MUST not be ignored. 


#### 2.3.2 Voiding

###### Rationale

The certainty that an LRS has an accurate and complete collection of data is guaranteed by the fact that Statements 
cannot be logically changed or deleted. This immutability of Statements is a key factor in enabling the distributed 
nature of Experience API.

However, not all Statements are perpetually valid once they have been issued. Mistakes or other factors could dictate 
that a previously made Statement is marked as invalid. This is called "voiding a Statement" and the reserved 
Verb `http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/voided` is used for this purpose. Any Statement that voids another
cannot itself be voided.

###### Requirements

* When issuing a Statement that voids another, the Object of that voiding Statement MUST have 
the "objectType" property set to `StatementRef`.
* When issuing a Statement that voids another, the Object of that voiding Statement MUST specify 
the id of the Statement-to-be-voided by its "id" property.
* An LRS MUST consider a Statement it contains voided if and only if the Statement is not itself 
a voiding Statement and the LRS also contains a voiding Statement referring to the first Statement.
* Upon receiving a Statement that voids another, the LRS SHOULD reject the entire request which 
includes the voiding Statement with `403 Forbidden` if the request is not from a source authorized to void Statements.
* Upon receiving a Statement that voids another, the LRS SHOULD NOT* reject the request on the 
grounds of the Object of that voiding Statement not being present. 
* Upon receiving a Statement that voids another, the LRS MAY roll back any changes to Activity or 
Agent definitions which were introduced by the Statement that was just voided.
* A Learning Record Provider that wants to "unvoid" a previously voided Statement SHOULD issue 
that Statement again under a new id.

__Note:__ See ["Statement References"](#statement-references) in [When the "Object" is a Statement](#2443-when-the-object-is-a-statement) 
for details about making references to other Statements.  To see how voided statements behave when queried, 
See [StatementRef](./xAPI-Communication.md#filter-conditions-for-statementrefs) in Part 3).

###### Example

This example Statement voids a previous Statement which it identifies with the Statement id "e05aa883-acaf-40ad-bf54-02c8ce485fb0".

```
{
	"actor" : {
		"objectType": "Agent",
		"name" : "Example Admin",
		"mbox" : "mailto:admin@example.adlnet.gov"
	},
	"verb" : {
		"id":"http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/voided",
		"display":{
			"en-US":"voided"
		}
	},
	"object" : {
		"objectType":"StatementRef",
		"id" : "e05aa883-acaf-40ad-bf54-02c8ce485fb0"
	}
}
```

###### Example

An example of the simplest possible Statement using all properties that MUST or SHOULD be used.
It is recommended to also populate optional properties where relevant. 
When this Statement is returned from the LRS it will include some additional properties added by the LRS.  
```
{
    "id": "12345678-1234-5678-1234-567812345678",
    "actor":{
        "mbox":"mailto:xapi@adlnet.gov"
    },
    "verb":{
        "id":"http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/created",
        "display":{
            "en-US":"created"
        }
    },
    "object":{
        "id":"http://example.adlnet.gov/xapi/example/activity"
    }
}
```  
See [Appendix A: Example Statements](#appendix-a-example-statements) for more examples. 


#### 2.4.1 ID 

###### Description

A UUID (all versions of variant 2 in [RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) are valid, and the UUID MUST 
be in standard string form).

###### Requirements

* Statement ids MUST be generated by the LRS if a Statement is received without an id.
* Statement ids SHOULD be generated by the Learning Record Provider.


#### 2.4.2 Actor  

###### Description
The Actor defines who performed the action. The Actor of a Statement can be an Agent or a Group. 


##### 2.4.2.1 When the Actor objectType is Agent
###### Description
An Agent (an individual) is a persona or system.

###### Details

* An Agent MUST be identified by one (1) of the four types of Inverse Functional Identifiers (see
 [2.4.2.3 Inverse Functional Identifier](#2423-inverse-functional-identifier));
* An Agent MUST NOT include more than one (1) Inverse Functional Identifier;
* An Agent SHOULD NOT use Inverse Functional Identifiers that are also used as a Group identifier.

The table below lists the properties of Agent Objects.

<table border ="1">
	<tr><th>Property</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Required</th></tr>
	<tr><td>objectType</td><td>string</td><td><code>Agent</code>. This property is optional except when the Agent is used as a Statement's object.</td>
	<td>Optional</td></tr>
	<tr><td>name</td><td>String</td><td>Full name of the Agent.</td>
	<td>Optional</td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan="2">see <a href="#2423-inverse-functional-identifier"> 2.4.2.3 Inverse Functional Identifier</a></td>
	    <td>An Inverse Functional Identifier unique to the Agent.</td>
	    <td>Required</td></tr>
</table>



##### 2.4.2.2 When the Actor ObjectType is Group
###### Description

A Group represents a collection of Agents and can be used in most of the same situations an Agent 
can be used.  There are two types of Groups: Anonymous Groups and Identified Groups.

###### Details

An Anonymous Group is used to describe a cluster of people where there is no ready identifier for 
this cluster, e.g. an ad hoc team.

The table below lists all properties of an Anonymous Group.

<table border ="1">
	<tr><th>Property</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Required</th></tr>
	<tr><td>objectType</td><td>String</td><td><code>Group</code>. </td><td>Required</td></tr>
	<tr><td>name</td><td>String</td><td>Name of the Group.</td><td>Optional</td></tr>
	<tr><td>member</td><td>Array of <a href="#2421-when-the-actor-objecttype-is-agent">Agent Objects</a></td>
	<td>The members of this Group. This is an unordered list.</td>
	<td>Required</td></tr>
</table>

An Identified Group is used to uniquely identify a cluster of Agents.

The table below lists all properties of an Identified Group.

<table border ="1">
	<tr><th>Property</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Required</th></tr>
	<tr><td>objectType</td><td>String</td><td><code>Group</code>. </td><td>Required</td></tr>
	<tr><td>name</td><td>String</td><td>Name of the Group.</td><td>Optional</td></tr>
	<tr><td>member</td><td>Array of <a href="#2421-when-the-actor-objecttype-is-agent">Agent Objects</a></td>
	<td>The members of this Group. This is an unordered list.</td>
	<td>Optional</td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan="2">see <a href="#2423-inverse-functional-identifier"> 2.4.2.3 Inverse Functional Identifier</a></td>
	    <td>An Inverse Functional Identifier unique to the Group.</td><td>Required</td></tr>	
</table>

###### Requirements

* A Learning Record Consumer MUST consider each Anonymous Group distinct even if it has an 
identical set of members.
* Learning Record Providers SHOULD use an Identified Group when they wish to issue multiple 
Statements, aggregate data or store and retrieve documents relating to a group.
* A Learning Record Provider MAY include a complete or partial list of Agents in the "member" 
property of a given Anonymous or Identified Group.
* An LRS returning a Statement MAY return the list of Group members in any order.

###### Requirements for Anonymous Groups

* An Anonymous Group MUST include a "member" property listing constituent Agents.
* An Anonymous Group MUST NOT contain Group Objects in the "member" identifiers.

###### Requirements for Identified Groups

* An Identified Group MUST include exactly one (1) Inverse Functional Identifier.
* An Identified Group MUST NOT contain Group Objects in the "member" property.
* An Identified Group SHOULD NOT use Inverse Functional Identifiers that are also used 
as Agent identifiers.
* An Identified Group MAY include a "member" property listing constituent Agents.


##### 2.4.2.3 Inverse Functional Identifier
###### Description
An Inverse Functional Identifier (IFI) is a value of an Agent or Identified
Group that is guaranteed to only ever refer to that Agent or Identified Group.

###### Rationale
Agents and Groups need to be uniquely identifiable in order for data to be stored and retrieved against them. 
In an xAPI Statement this is accomplished using Inverse Functional Identifiers which are loosely inspired 
by the widely accepted FOAF principle (see: [Friend Of A Friend](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_Agent)).

###### Details

The table below lists all possible Inverse Functional Identifier properties.

<table border ="1">
	<tr><th>Property</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
	<tr><td><a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_mbox">mbox</a></td><td>mailto IRI</td><td>The required format is "mailto:email address". <br>
	Only email addresses that have only ever been and will ever be assigned to this Agent, 
but no others, SHOULD be used for this property and mbox_sha1sum.</td></tr>
	<tr><td><a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_mbox_sha1sum">mbox_sha1sum</a></td><td>String</td><td>The hex-encoded SHA1 hash of a mailto IRI (i.e. the value of an mbox property). An LRS MAY include Agents with a matching hash when a request is based on an mbox.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>openid</td><td>URI</td><td>An openID that uniquely identifies the Agent.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>account</td><td><a href="#2424-account-object">Object</a></td><td>A user account on an existing system e.g. an LMS or intranet.</td></tr>	
</table>

###### Client Requirements
* The domain portions of email addresses are case insensitive. Clients SHOULD use lowercase 
for the domain portion of the email address when calculating the SHA1 hash for the "mbox_sha1sum" property. 


##### 2.4.2.4 Account Object

###### Description

A user account on an existing system, such as a private system (LMS or intranet) or a public
system (social networking site).

###### Details

* If the system that provides the account Object uses OpenID, the Learning Record Provider
SHOULD use the openid property instead of an account Object.
* If the Learning Record Provider is concerned about revealing personally identifiable
information about an Agent or Group, it SHOULD use an opaque account name (for example an
account number) to identify all Statements about a person while maintaining anonymity.

The table below lists all properties of Account Objects.

<table border ="1">
	<tr><th>Property</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Required</th></tr>
	<tr><td>homePage</td><td>IRL</td><td>The canonical home page for the system the account is on. This is based on FOAF's accountServiceHomePage.</td>
	<td>Required</td></tr>
	<tr><td>name</td><td>String</td><td>The unique id or name used to log in to this account. This is based on FOAF's accountName.</td><td>Required</td></tr>
</table>


###### Example

This example shows an Agent identified by an opaque account:

```
{
	"objectType": "Agent",
	"account": {
		"homePage": "http://www.example.com",
		"name": "1625378"
	}
}
``` 


#### 2.4.3 Verb

###### Description

The Verb defines the action between an Actor and an Activity. 

###### Rationale

The Verb in an xAPI Statement describes the action performed during the learning experience. The 
xAPI does not specify any particular Verbs. (With one exception, namely the reserved 
Verb [http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/voided](#232-voiding)). Instead, it defines how to create Verbs so that 
communities of practice can establish Verbs meaningful to their members and make them available 
for use by anyone. A predefined list of Verbs would be limited by definition and might not be able to 
effectively capture all possible future learning experiences. 

###### Details

Verbs appear in Statements as Objects consisting of an IRI and a set of display names 
corresponding to multiple languages or dialects which provide human-readable meanings of the Verb. 
The table below lists all properties of the Verb Object.

<table>
	<tr><th>Property</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Required</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>id</td>
		<td>IRI</td>
		<td>Corresponds to a Verb definition. Each Verb definition 
			corresponds to the meaning of a Verb, not the word. 
		</td>
		<td>Required</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>display</td>
		<td><a href="#lang-map">Language Map</a></td>
		<td>The human readable representation of the 
			Verb in one or more languages. This does not have any impact on the 
			meaning of the Statement, but serves to give a human-readable 
			display of the meaning already determined by the chosen Verb.</td>
		<td>Recommended</td>
	</tr>
</table>

###### Verb Id Requirements

* A system reading a Statement MUST use the Verb IRI to infer meaning.
* The IRI contained in an id SHOULD contain a human-readable portion which SHOULD provide meaning enough 
for a person reviewing the raw statement to disambiguate the Verb from other similar (in syntax) Verbs.
* A single Verb IRI MUST NOT be used to refer to multiple meanings.

###### Verb Display Learning Record Provider Requirements

* The "display" property SHOULD be used by all Statements.
* The "display" property MUST be used to illustrate the meaning which is already determined 
by the Verb IRI.

###### Verb Display LRS Requirements

The requirements below relate to the "display" property as returned by the LRS via the API.  

* When queried for Statements with a Format of `exact`, the LRS MUST return the "display" property 
exactly as included (or omitted) within the Statement.
* When queried for Statements with a Format of `ids`, the LRS SHOULD* NOT include the "display" property.
* When queried for Statements with a Format of `canonical`, the LRS SHOULD* return a 
canonical Display for that Verb. 
* The LRS may determine its canonical Display based on the Verb's "display" property included within 
Statements it receives, the "name" property included in the metadata as described in 
[3.2 Hosted Metadata](#32-hosted-metadata), or the Verb's Display as defined in some other location.

###### Verb Display Learning Record Consumer Requirements

The requirements below relate to the display property as displayed to a user by a Learning Record Consumer. 

* The "display" property MUST NOT be used to alter the meaning of a Verb.
* A Learning Record Consumer MUST NOT use the "display" property to infer any meaning from the Statement.
* A Learning Record Consumer MUST NOT use the "display" property for any purpose other than 
to display to a human. Using the "display" property for aggregation or categorization of Statements is an example of 
violating this requirement. 
* A Learning Record Consumer displaying a Statement's Verb in a user interface MAY choose to render 
the Verb's "display" property included within the Statement, the "name" property included in the metadata as described in 
[3.2 Hosted Metadata](#32-hosted-metadata), or the Verb's Display as defined in some other location.
* Learning Record Consumers displaying a Statement's Verb MUST NOT display a word that differs 
from the meaning of the Verb but MAY alter the wording and tense displayed for the purposes of human-readability. 

###### Example
This example shows a Verb with the recommended properties set and using US English and Spanish languages. 
```
{
    "id":"http://example.com/xapi/verbs#defenestrated", 
    "display":{
        "en-US":"defenestrated",
        "es" : "defenestrado" 
    } 
}
``` 

The Verb in the example above is included for illustrative purposes only. This is not intended to imply that
a Verb with this meaning has been defined with this id. This applies to all example verbs given in this 
specification document, with the exception of the reserved Verb [http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/voided](#232-voiding)).
			
##### 2.4.3.1 Use in Language and Semantics of Verbs

###### Details

_Semantics_

The IRI represented by the Verb id identifies the particular semantics of a word, not the word itself. 

For example, the English word "fired" could mean different things depending on context, such as 
"fired(a weapon)", "fired(a kiln)", or "fired(an employee)". In this case, an IRI identifies one of 
these specific meanings. 

The "display" property has some flexibility in tense. While the human-readable portion of the Verb id will 
usually use the past tense, if conjugating verbs to another tense within the "display" property makes the most
sense for the Statement as a whole, it is allowed.

_Language_

A Verb in the Experience API is an IRI, and denotes a specific meaning not tied to any particular language. 

For example, a particular Verb IRI such as http://example.org/firearms#fire might denote the action of firing a gun, 
or the Verb IRI http://example.com/فعل/خواندن might denote the action of reading a book. 


#### 2.4.4 Object

###### Description

The Object defines the thing that was acted on. The Object of a Statement can be an Activity, Agent/Group, 
SubStatement, or Statement Reference.

Some examples:

* The Object is an Activity: "Jeff wrote an essay about hiking."

* The Object is an Agent: "Nellie interviewed Jeff."

* The Object is a SubStatement or Statement Reference (different implementations, but similar 
when human-read): "Nellie commented on 'Jeff wrote an essay about hiking.'"

###### Details

Objects which are provided as a value for this property SHOULD include an "objectType" property. If not specified, the 
objectType is assumed to be `Activity`. Other valid values are: `Agent`, `Group`, `SubStatement` or `StatementRef`.
The properties of an Object change according to the objectType.


##### 2.4.4.1 When the ObjectType is Activity

###### Details

A Statement can represent an Activity as the Object of the Statement. The following table lists the Object 
properties in this case.

<table>
	<tr><th>Property</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Required</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>objectType</td>
		<td>String</td>
		<td>MUST be <code>Activity</code> when present</td>
		<td>Optional</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><a href="#activity-id-requirements">id</a></td><td>IRI</td>
		<td>An identifier for a single unique Activity</td>
		<td>Required</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><a href="#activity-definition">definition</a></td>
		<td>Object</td>
		<td>Metadata, <a href="#activity-definition">See below</a></td>
		<td>Optional</td>
	</tr>
</table>

If it were possible to use the same id for two different Activities, the validity of Statements about 
these Activities could be questioned. This means an LRS can't ever treat (references to) the same 
Activity id as belonging to two different Activities, even if it thinks this was intended. Namely, 
when a conflict with another system occurs, it’s not possible to determine which Activity is intended. 


###### Activity Definition
The table below lists the properties of the Activity Definition Object:

<table>
	<tr><th>Property</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Required</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>name</td>
		<td><a href="#42-language-maps">Language Map</a></td>
		<td>The human readable/visual name of the Activity</td>
		<td>Recommended</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>description</td>
		<td><a href="#42-language-maps">Language Map</a></td>
		<td>A description of the Activity</td>
		<td>Recommended</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<a name="acttype"></a>
		<td>type</td>
		<td>IRI</td>
		<td>The type of Activity.</td>
		<td>Recommended</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>moreInfo</td>
		<td>IRL</td>
		<td>Resolves to a document with human-readable information about the Activity, 
		which could include a way to launch the activity.
		</td>
		<td>Optional</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="4">Interaction properties, See: <a href="#interaction-activities">Interaction Activities</a></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>extensions</td>
		<td>Object</td>
		<td>A map of other properties as needed (see: <a href="#41-extensions">Extensions</a>)</td>
		<td>Optional</td>
	</tr>
</table>

__Note:__ IRI fragments (sometimes called relative IRLs) are not valid IRIs. As with Verbs, it is recommended that
those implementing xAPI look for and use established, widely adopted, Activity types.


###### Activity id Requirements

* An Activity id MUST be unique.
* An Activity id MUST always reference the same Activity.
* An Activity id SHOULD use a domain that the creator is authorized to use for this purpose.
* An Activity id SHOULD be created according to a scheme that makes sure all Activity ids within 
that domain remain unique.
* An Activity id MAY point to metadata or the IRL for the Activity.

###### LRS Requirements

* An LRS MUST NOT take action in the event it perceives an Activity id is being used by multiple 
authors and/or organizations.
* An LRS MUST NOT treat references to the same Activity id as references to different Activities.
* Upon receiving a Statement with an Activity Definition that differs from the one stored, an LRS
SHOULD decide whether it considers the Learning Record Provider to have the authority to change the definition and
SHOULD update the stored Activity Definition accordingly if that decision is positive.
* An LRS MAY make small corrections to its canonical definition for the Activity when receiving 
a new definition e.g. to fix a spelling.
* An LRS SHOULD NOT make significant changes to its canonical definition for the Activity 
based on an updated definition e.g. changes to correct responses.

###### Learning Record Provider Requirements

* A Learning Record Provider MUST ensure that Activity ids are not used across multiple Activities.
* A Learning Record Provider MUST only generate states or Statements against a certain Activity id 
that are compatible and consistent with states or Statements previously stored against the same Activity id.
* A Learning Record Provider MUST NOT allow new versions (i.e. revisions or other platforms) 
of the Activity to break compatibility.	

##### Interaction Activities

###### Rationale

Traditional e-learning has included structures for interactions or assessments. As a way to allow these practices and
structures to extend Experience API's utility, this specification includes built-in definitions for interactions, which
borrows from the SCORM 2004 4th Edition Data Model. These definitions are intended to provide a simple and familiar utility
for recording interaction data. Since 1.0.3, direct references to the SCORM data model have started to be removed, and any
associated requirements included directly in this document.

These interaction definitions are simple to use, and consequently limited. It is expected that Communities of Practice
requiring richer interactions definitions will do so through the use of Activity types and Activity Definition Extensions. 

###### Details

The table below lists the properties for Interaction Activities.

<table>
	<tr><th>Property</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Required</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>interactionType</td>
		<td>String</td>
		<td>The type of interaction. Possible values are: <code>true-false</code>, <code>choice</code>, <code>fill-in</code>, <code>long-fill-in</code>,
		<code>matching</code>, <code>performance</code>, <code>sequencing</code>, <code>likert</code>, <code>numeric</code> or <code>other</code>. </td>
		<td>Required</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>correctResponsesPattern</td>
		<td>Array of Strings</td>
		<td>A pattern representing the correct response to the interaction. The structure of this pattern varies
		depending on the interactionType. This is detailed below. </td>
		<td>Optional</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>choices | scale | source | target | steps</td>
		<td>Array of interaction components</td>
		<td>Specific to the given interactionType (see below).</td>
		<td>Optional</td>
	</tr>
</table>

###### Interaction Types

The table below describes the kinds of interactions represented by each of the interactionTypes. These types of interactions 
were originally based on the types of interactions allowed for "cmi.interactions.n.type" in the SCORM 2004 4th 
Edition Run-Time Environment. See [Appendix C](#appendix-c-example-definitions-for-activities-of-type-cmiinteraction) for examples definitions for each interaction type. 

<table>
	<tr><th>interactionType</th><th>Description</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>true-false</td>
		<td>An interaction with two possible responses: <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>choice</td>
		<td>An interaction with a number of possible choices from which the learner can select. 
			This includes interactions in which the learner can select only one answer from the list and
			those where the learner can select multiple items.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>fill-in</td>
		<td>An interaction which requires the learner to supply a short response in the form of one or more 
			strings of characters. Typically, the correct response consists of part of a word, one word or a few words. 
			"Short" means that the correct responses pattern and learner response strings will normally be 250 characters or less.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>long-fill-in</td>
		<td>An interaction which requires the learner to supply a response in the form of a long string of characters.
			"Long" means that the correct responses pattern and learner response strings will normally be more than 250 characters.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>matching</td>
		<td>An interaction where the learner is asked to match items in one set (the source set) to items in another set (the target set).
			Items do not have to pair off exactly and it is possible for multiple or zero source items to be matched to a given target and vice versa.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>performance</td>
		<td>An interaction that requires the learner to perform a task that requires multiple steps.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>sequencing</td>
		<td>An interaction where the learner is asked to order items in a set.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>likert</td>
		<td>An interaction which asks the learner to select from a discrete set of choices on a scale</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>numeric</td>
		<td>Any interaction which requires a numeric response from the learner.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>other</td>
		<td>Another type of interaction that does not fit into those defined above.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

###### Response Patterns
The table below outlines the format of the strings within "correctResponsesPattern" property for each interaction type. 
This format is also used to represent the learner's response within the Result Object. These formats were originally based on the 
requirements relating to "cmi.interactions.n.correct_responses.n.pattern" as defined in the SCORM 2004 4th Edition 
Run-Time Environment. See [Appendix C](#appendix-c-example-definitions-for-activities-of-type-cmiinteraction) for examples of each format. 

<table>
	<tr><th>interactionType</th><th>Format</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>true-false</td>
		<td>Either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>choice</td>
		<td>A list of item ids delimited by <code>[,]</code>. If the response contains only one item, the delimiter MUST not be used.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>fill-in and long-fill-in</td>
		<td>A list of responses delimited by <code>[,]</code>. If the response contains only one item, the delimiter MUST not be used.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>matching</td>
		<td>A list of matching pairs, where each  pair consists of a source item id followed by a target item id. 
			Items can appear in multiple (or zero) pairs.
			Items within a pair are delimited by <code>[.]</code>. Pairs are delimited by <code>[,]</code>.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>performance</td>
		<td>
			A list of steps containing a step ids and the response to that step.
			Step ids are separated from responses by <code>[.]</code>. Steps are delimited by <code>[,]</code>.
			The response can be a String as in a fill-in interaction or a number range as in a numeric interaction. 
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>sequencing</td>
		<td>An ordered list of item ids delimited by <code>[,]</code>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>likert</td>
		<td>A single item id</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>numeric</td>
		<td>A range of numbers represented by a minimum and a maximum delimited by <code>[:]</code>. 
			Where the range does not have a maximum or does not have a minimum, that number is omitted but the delimiter is
			still used. E.g. <code>[:]4</code> indicates a maximum for 4 and no minimum. 
			Where the correct response or learner's response is a single number rather than a range, the single number
			with no delimiter MAY be used. 
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>other</td>
		<td>Any format is valid within this string as appropriate for the type of interaction.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

###### Correct Responses Pattern

The Correct Responses Pattern contains an array of response patterns. A learner's response will be considered correct if it 
matches **any** of the response patterns in that array. Where a response pattern is a delimited list, the learner's response 
is only considered correct if **all** of the items in that list match the learner's response. For example, consider the 
Correct Responses Pattern with a value of:

```
"correctResponsesPattern": [
    "foo[,]bar",
    "foo"
]
``` 

In this example, either "foo" and "bar", *or* just "foo" are correct learner responses; "bar" on it's own is not.

The Correct Responses Pattern, if used, is intended to be an exhaustive list of possible correct responses. Where the criteria 
for a question are complex and correct responses cannot be exhaustively listed, Learning Record Providers are discouraged from 
using the "correctResponsesPattern" property.

Learning Record Consumers cannot infer success based on comparison of the response with the Correct Responses Pattern, 
nor can they rely on the Correct Responses Pattern always being exhaustive. The Learning Record Provider is allowed to mark 
questions as correct where the response does not match the correct responses pattern, though this is discouraged except in 
exceptional circumstances.

Where the Correct Responses Pattern contains an empty array, the meaning of this is that there is no correct
answer; all answers are incorrect. Where any answer is correct (e.g. in a survey), the Correct Responses Pattern property
is omitted. 

###### Characterstring parameters

Some of the values within the responses described above can be prepended with certain additional parameters. These were 
originally based on the characterstring delimiters defined in the SCORM 2004 4th Edition Run-Time Environment. These 
parameters are represented by the format `{parameter=value}`. See [the long-fill-in example within Appendix C](#long-fill-in). 

Characterstring parameters are not validated by the LRS. Systems interpreting Statement data can use their best judgement 
in interpreting (or ignoring) invalid characterstring parameters and values.

The following parameters are valid at the start of the string representing the list of items for the listed interaction types:
<table>
	<tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Default</th><th>Description</th><th>Value</th><th>Interaction types</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>case_matters</td>
		<td>false</td>
		<td>Whether or not the case of items in the list matters.</td>
		<td><code>true</code> or <code>false</code></td>
		<td>fill-in, long-fill-in</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>order_matters</td>
		<td>true</td>
		<td>Whether or not the order of items in the list matters.</td>
		<td><code>true</code> or <code>false</code></td>
		<td>fill-in, long-fill-in, performance</td>
	</tr>
</table>

The following parameters are valid at the start of each item in the list for the listed interaction types:
<table>
	<tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th><th>Value</th><th>Interaction types</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>lang</td>
		<td>The language used within the item.</td>
		<td><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646">RFC 5646 Language Tag</a></td>
		<td>fill-in, long-fill-in, performance (String responses only)</td>
	</tr>
</table>


###### Requirements

* Interaction Activities MUST have a valid interactionType.
* Interaction Activities SHOULD have the Activity type 
`http://adlnet.gov/expapi/activities/cmi.interaction`.
* An LRS, upon consuming a valid interactionType, MAY validate the remaining properties as 
specified for Interaction Activities and MAY return `400 Bad Request` if the remaining properties are not valid for the 
Interaction Activity.
* The LRS SHOULD* NOT enforce character limits relating to response patterns. 
* The LRS SHOULD* NOT limit the length of the correctResponsesPattern array for any interactionType. 


##### Interaction Components

###### Details

Interaction components are defined as follows:  

<table>
	<tr><th>Property</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Required</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>id</td>
		<td>String</td>
		<td>Identifies the interaction component within the list.</td>
        <td>Required</td>
	<tr>
		<td>description</td>
		<td><a href="#42-language-maps">Language Map</a></td>
		<td>A description of the interaction component 
			(for example, the text for a given choice in a multiple-choice interaction)</td>
		<td>Optional</td>
	</tr>
</table>


Depending on interactionType, Interaction Activities can take additional properties, each containing a 
list of interaction components. These additional properties are called "interaction component lists". The following table
shows the supported interaction component list(s) for an Interaction Activity with the given interactionType.

<table>
	<tr><th>interactionType</th><th>supported interaction component list(s)</th><th>Description</th><tr>
	<tr><td>choice, sequencing</td><td>choices</td>
	<td>A list of the options available in the interaction for selection or ordering.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>likert</td><td>scale</td>
	<td>A list of the options on the likert scale.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>matching</td><td>source, target</td>
	<td>Lists of sources and targets to be matched.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>performance</td><td>steps</td>
	<td>A list of the elements making up the performance interaction.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>true-false, fill-in, long-fill-in, numeric, other</td><td>[No component lists supported]</td><td></td></tr>
</table>


###### Requirements

* Within an array of interaction components, all id values MUST be distinct.
* An interaction component's id value SHOULD NOT have whitespace.

###### Examples

See [Appendix C](#appendix-c-example-definitions-for-activities-of-type-cmiinteraction) for examples of Activity Definitions for each of the cmi.interaction types.


##### 2.4.4.2 When the "Object" is an Agent or a Group

###### Requirements

* Statements that specify an Agent or Group as an Object MUST specify an "objectType" property. 

See [Actor](#242-actor) for details regarding Agents.  


##### 2.4.4.3 When the "Object" is a Statement

###### Rationale

There are two possibilities for using a Statement as an Object. First, an Object can take on the form 
of a Statement that already exists by using a Statement Reference. A common use case for 
Statement References is grading or commenting on an experience that could be tracked as an 
independent event. The special case of voiding a Statement would also use a Statement Reference.
Second, an Object can be a brand new Statement by using a SubStatement. Each type is defined below.


##### Statement References

###### Description
A Statement Reference is a pointer to another pre-existing Statement.

###### Requirements

* A Statement Reference MUST specify an "objectType" property with the value `StatementRef`.
* A Statement Reference MUST set the "id" property to the UUID of a Statement. There is no 
requirement for the LRS to validate that the UUID matches a Statement that exists.

The table below lists all properties of a Statement Reference Object:

<table border ="1">
	<tr><th>Property</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Required</th></tr>
	<tr><td>objectType</td><td>String</td><td>In this case, MUST be <code>StatementRef</code>.</td><td>Required</td></tr>
	<tr><td>id</td><td>UUID</td><td>The UUID of a Statement. 
	</td><td>Required</td></tr>
</table>

###### Example

Assuming that some Statement has already been stored with the id `8f87ccde-bb56-4c2e-ab83-44982ef22df0`, the following example 
shows how a comment could be issued on the original Statement, using a new Statement:  

```
{
	"actor" : { 
		"objectType": "Agent", 
		"mbox":"mailto:test@example.com" 
	},
	"verb" : { 
		"id":"http://example.com/commented", 
		"display": {
			"en-US":"commented"
		} 
	},
	"object" : {
		"objectType":"StatementRef",
		"id":"8f87ccde-bb56-4c2e-ab83-44982ef22df0"
	},
	"result" : { 
		"response" : "Wow, nice work!" 
	}
}
``` 


##### SubStatements

###### Description
A SubStatement is like a StatementRef in that it is included as part of a containing Statement, but unlike a StatementRef, it 
does not represent an event that has occurred. It can be used to describe, for example, a predication of a potential future 
Statement or the behavior a teacher looked for when evaluating a student (without representing the student actually doing that 
behavior). 

###### Requirements

* A SubStatement MUST specify an "objectType" property with the value `SubStatement`.
* A SubStatement MUST be validated as a Statement in addition to other SubStatement requirements.
* A SubStatement MUST NOT have the "id", "stored", "version" or "authority" properties.
* A SubStatement MUST NOT contain a SubStatement of its own, i.e., cannot be nested.

###### Example

One interesting use of SubStatements is in creating Statements of intention. For example, using SubStatements we can create 
Statements of the form `"<I> <planned> (<I> <did> <this>)"` to indicate that we've planned to take some action. The concrete 
example that follows logically states that "I planned to visit 'Some Awesome Website'". 
 


```
{
	"actor": {
		"objectType": "Agent", 
		"mbox":"mailto:test@example.com" 
	},
	"verb" : { 
		"id":"http://example.com/planned", 
		"display":{
			"en-US":"planned"
		} 
	},
	"object": {
		"objectType": "SubStatement",
		"actor" : {
			"objectType": "Agent", 
			"mbox":"mailto:test@example.com" 
		},
		"verb" : { 
			"id":"http://example.com/visited", 
			"display":{
				"en-US":"will visit"
			} 
		},
		"object": {
			"objectType": "Activity",
			"id":"http://example.com/website",
			"definition": { 
				"name" : {
					"en-US":"Some Awesome Website"
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```


#### 2.4.5 Result

###### Description

An optional property that represents a measured outcome related to the Statement in which it is included.

###### Details

The following table contains the properties of the Result Object.

<table border="1">

##### 2.4.5.1 Score

###### Description
An optional property that represents the outcome of a graded Activity achieved by an Agent.

###### Details

The table below defines the Score Object. 

<table border ="1">
	<tr><th>Property</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Required</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>scaled</td>
		<td>Decimal number between -1 and 1, inclusive</td>
		<td>The score related to the experience as modified by scaling and/or normalization. 
		</td>
		<td>Recommended</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>raw</td>
		<td>Decimal number between min and max (if present, otherwise unrestricted), inclusive</td>
		<td>The score achieved by the Actor in the experience described by the Statement. This is not modified by
		any scaling or normalization.</td>
		<td>Optional</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>min</td>
		<td>Decimal number less than max (if present)</td>
		<td>The lowest possible score for the experience described by the Statement.</td>
		<td>Optional</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>max</td>
		<td>Decimal number greater than min (if present)</td>
		<td>The highest possible score for the experience described by the Statement.</td>
		<td>Optional</td>
	</tr>
</table>

The properties of the Score Object are based on the corresponding properties of `cmi.score` as defined in SCORM 2004 
4th Edition. The "scaled" and "raw" properties do not necessarily relate directly as scaling and normalization can
be applied differently by Learning Record Providers within different Communities of Practice. Scaling and normalization 
are outside the scope of this specification.

###### Requirements

* The Score Object SHOULD include "scaled" if a logical percent based score is known.
* The Score Object SHOULD NOT be used for scores relating to progress or completion. Consider 
using an extension (preferably from an established Community of Practice) instead.


#### 2.4.6 Context

###### Description
An optional property that provides a place to add contextual information to a Statement. All "context" properties are optional.

###### Rationale
The "context" property provides a place to add some contextual information to a Statement. It can store information such 
as the instructor for an experience, if this experience happened as part of a team-based Activity, or how an experience fits 
into some broader activity.

###### Details

The following table contains the properties of the Context Object.

<table border="1">
<tr><th>Property</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Required</th></tr>
<tr>
	<td>registration</td>
	<td>UUID</td>
	<td>The registration that the Statement is associated with.</td>
	<td>Optional</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>instructor</td>
	<td>Agent (MAY be a Group)</td>
	<td>Instructor that the Statement relates to, if not included as the Actor of the Statement.</td>
	<td>Optional</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>team</td>
	<td>Group</td>
	<td>Team that this Statement relates to, if not included as the Actor of the Statement.</td>
	<td>Optional</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>contextActivities</td>
	<td>contextActivities Object</td>
	<td>A map of the types of learning activity context that this Statement is related to.
	Valid context types are: <code>parent</code>, <code>grouping</code>, <code>category</code> and <code>other</code>.</td>
	<td>Optional</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>revision</td>
	<td>String</td>
	<td>Revision of the learning activity associated with this Statement. Format is free.
	<td>Optional</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>platform</td>
	<td>String</td>
	<td>Platform used in the experience of this learning activity. </td>
	<td>Optional</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>language</td>
	<td>String (as defined in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646">RFC 5646</a>)</td>
	<td>Code representing the language in which the experience being recorded in this 
	Statement (mainly) occurred in, if applicable and known.
	</td>
	<td>Optional</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>statement</td>
	<td><a href="#statement-references">Statement Reference</a></td>
	<td>Another Statement to be considered as context for this Statement. </td>
	<td>Optional</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>extensions</td>
	<td>Object</td>
	<td>A map of any other domain-specific context relevant to this Statement. For example, 
	in a flight simulator altitude, airspeed, wind, attitude, GPS coordinates might all be 
	relevant (<a href="#41-extensions">See Extensions</a>)</td>
	<td>Optional</td>
</tr>

</table>

###### Requirements

* The "revision" property MUST only be used if the Statement's Object is an Activity.
* The "platform" property MUST only be used if the Statement's Object is an Activity.
* The "language" property MUST NOT be used if not applicable or unknown.
* The "revision" property SHOULD be used to track fixes of minor issues (like a spelling error).
* The "revision" property SHOULD NOT be used if there is a major change in learning objectives, pedagogy, 
or assets of an Activity. (Use a new Activity id instead).

__Note:__ Revision has no behavioral implications within the scope of xAPI. It is simply stored
so that it is available (e.g. for interpreting and displaying data).


##### 2.4.6.1 Registration Property

###### Rationale/Details

When an LRS is an integral part of an LMS, the LMS likely supports the concept of registration. 
The Experience API applies the concept of registration more broadly. A registration could be 
considered to be an attempt, a session, or could span multiple Activities. There is no expectation that 
completing an Activity ends a registration. Nor is a registration necessarily confined to a single Agent.

The Registration is also used when storing documents within the State Resource, e.g. for 
bookmarking. Normally the same registration is used for requests to both the Statement and 
State Resources relating to the same learning experience so that all data recorded for the experience is consistent. 


##### 2.4.6.2 ContextActivities Property

###### Description

A map of the types of learning activity context that this Statement is related to.

###### Rationale

Many Statements do not just involve one (Object) Activity that is the focus, but relate to other contextually relevant 
Activities. The "contextActivities" property allow for these related Activities to be represented in a structured manner.

###### Details

There are four valid context types. All, any or none of these MAY be used in a given Statement:

* __Parent__: an Activity with a direct relation to the Activity which is the Object of the Statement. 
In almost all cases there is only one sensible parent or none, not multiple. For example: a Statement about a quiz question
would have the quiz as its parent Activity.
 
* __Grouping__: an Activity with an indirect relation to the Activity which is the Object of the 
Statement. For example: a course that is part of a qualification. The course has several classes. The course relates to a class 
as the parent, the qualification relates to the class as the grouping.

* __Category__: an Activity used to categorize the Statement. "Tags" would be a synonym. 
Category SHOULD be used to indicate a profile of xAPI behaviors, as well as other categorizations. For example: Anna attempts 
a biology exam, and the Statement is tracked using the cmi5 profile. The Statement's Activity refers to the exam, and the 
category is the cmi5 profile.

* __Other__: a contextActivity that doesn't fit one of the other properties. For example: Anna 
studies a textbook for a biology exam. The Statement's Activity refers to the textbook, and the exam is a contextActivity 
of type `other`.

Single Activity Objects are allowed as values so that 0.95 Statements will be compatible with 1.0.0.

__Note:__ The values in this section are not for expressing all the relationships the Statement Object has. Instead, they 
are for expressing relationships appropriate for the specific Statement (though the nature of the Object will often be 
important in determining that). For instance, it is appropriate in a Statement about a test to include the course the test 
is part of as a "parent", but not to include every possible degree program the course could be part of in the grouping value.

###### Requirements
* Every key in the contextActivities Object MUST be one of parent, grouping, category, or other.
* Every value in the contextActivities Object MUST be either a single Activity Object or an array of Activity Objects.
* The LRS MUST return every value in the contextActivities Object as an array, even if it arrived as a single Activity Object.
* The LRS MUST return single Activity Objects as an array of length one containing the same Activity.
* The Learning Record Provider SHOULD ensure that every value in the contextActivities Object is an array of Activity Objects 
instead of a single Activity Object.

###### Example

Consider the following hierarchical structure: "Questions 1 to 6"
are part of "Test 1" which in turn belongs to the course "Algebra 1". 
The six questions are registered as part of the test by declaring
"Test 1" as their parent. Also they are grouped with other Statements
about "Algebra 1" to fully mirror the hierarchy. This is particularly
useful when the Object of the Statement is an Agent, not an Activity.
"Andrew mentored Ben with context Algebra I".

```
{
    "parent" : [
        {
            "id" : "http://example.adlnet.gov/xapi/example/test1"
        }
    ],
    "grouping" : [
        {
            "id" : "http://example.adlnet.gov/xapi/example/Algebra1"
        }
    ]
}
```


#### 2.4.7 Timestamp

###### Description

The time at which the experience occurred.

###### Details

The "timestamp" property is of type [Timestamp](#45-iso-8601-timestamps). It is formatted according to the normal format of ISO 8601 and 
corresponds to the time of when the events described within this Statement occurred. If it is not included in the Statement 
when it is submitted to the LRS, the LRS populates it with the same value it would use with [Stored](#248-stored).

The "timestamp property" in a Statement can differ from the ["stored" property](#248-stored) (the time at which the Statement is 
stored). Namely, there can be delays between the occurrence of the experience and the reception of the corresponding 
Statement by the LRS. 

Where the experience occurs over a period of time, the "timestamp" property can represent the start, end or any point of time 
during the experience. It is expected that Communities of Practice will define an appropriate point to record the 
timestamp for different experiences. For example, when recording the experience of eating at a restaurant, it might 
be most appropriate to record the timestamp of the start of the experience; when recording the experience of 
completing a qualification, it might be most appropriate to record the timestamp of the end of the experience.
These examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not meant to be prescriptive.

###### Requirements

* For requirements pertaining to the Timestamp data type, see [Section 4.5 ISO 8601 Timestamps](#45-iso-8601-timestamps).
* The "timestamp" property SHOULD* be set by the LRS to the value of the ["stored" property](#248-stored) 
if not provided.
* A "timestamp" property MAY represent any point during an experience, not necessarily the 
beginning or end. 
* A Learning Record Provider MUST NOT use a future time for a "timestamp" property in a Statement.
* A SubStatement MAY have a "timestamp" property that is in the future.
* An LRS SHOULD* NOT reject a timestamp for having a greater value than the current time, to prevent 
issues due to clock errors.


#### 2.4.8 Stored

###### Description

The time at which a Statement is stored by the LRS. This can be any time between when the LRS receives the Statement and 
when it is written to storage. 

###### Details

The "stored" property is of type [Timestamp](#45-iso-8601-timestamps). The "stored" property is the literal time the Statement was stored. 

###### Requirements

* For requirements pertaining to the Timestamp data type, see [ISO 8601 Timestamps](#45-iso-8601-timestamps) below.
* The "stored" property MUST be set by the LRS; An LRS SHOULD validate and then MUST overwrite any 
value currently in the "stored" property of a Statement it receives.
* The "stored" property SHOULD be the current or a past time.


#### 2.4.9 Authority

###### Description

The authority property provides information about whom or what has asserted that this Statement is true. 

###### Details

The asserting authority represents the authenticating user or some system or application.

###### Requirements

* Authority MUST be an Agent, except in 3-legged OAuth, where it MUST be a Group with two Agents. 
The two Agents represent an application and user together.
* The LRS MUST include the user as an Agent as the entire authority if a user connects 
directly (using HTTP Basic Authentication) or is included as part of a Group. 
* The LRS MUST ensure that all Statements stored have an authority.
* The LRS SHOULD overwrite the authority on all Statements it stores,
based on the credentials used to send those Statements.
* The LRS MAY leave the submitted authority unchanged but SHOULD do so only 
where a strong trust relationship has been established, and with extreme caution.
* The LRS MAY identify the user with any of the legal identifying properties if 
a user connects directly (using HTTP Basic Authentication) or a part of 3-legged OAuth. 

##### OAuth Credentials as Authority

###### Description

This is a workflow for use of OAuth. 2-legged and 3-legged OAuth are both supported.

###### Details

This workflow assumes a Statement is stored using a validated OAuth connection and the LRS 
creates or modifies the authority property of the Statement.

In a 3-legged OAuth workflow, authentication involves both an OAuth consumer and a user of the 
OAuth service provider. For instance, requests made by an authorized Twitter plug-in on their 
Facebook account will include credentials that are specific not only to Twitter as a Client application, 
or them as a user, but the unique combination of both.

###### Requirements

* The authority MUST contain an Agent Object that represents the OAuth consumer, either by itself, or 
as part of a group in the case of 3-legged OAuth.
* The Agent representing the OAuth consumer MUST be identified by account.
* The Agent representing the OAuth consumer MUST use the consumer key as the value of the 
account's "name" property.
* If the Agent representing the OAuth consumer is a registered application, the token request endpoint 
MUST be used as the value of the account's "homePage" property.
* If the Agent representing the OAuth consumer is not a registered application, the temporary 
credentials endpoint MUST be used as the value of the account's "homePage" property.
* An LRS MUST NOT trust the application portion of the authority in the event the account name is from 
the same source as the unregistered application. (Multiple unregistered applications could choose the same consumer key. 
As a result, there is no consistent way to verify this combination of temporary credentials and the account name.) 
* Each unregistered consumer SHOULD use a unique consumer key.

###### Example

The pairing of an OAuth consumer and a user.

```
"authority": {
	"objectType" : "Group",
	"member": [
		{
			"account": {
				"homePage":"http://example.com/xAPI/OAuth/Token",
				"name":"oauth_consumer_x75db"
			}
		},
		{ 
			"mbox":"mailto:bob@example.com" 
		}
	]
}
```


#### 2.4.10 Version
###### Description

Version information in Statements helps Learning Record Consumers get their bearings. Since
the Statement data model is guaranteed consistent through all 1.0.x versions, in order to support data
flow among such LRSs, the LRS is given some flexibility on Statement versions that are accepted.

###### Requirements

* Version MUST be formatted as laid out for the API version header in [Versioning](./xAPI-Communication.md#33-versioning)

###### LRS Requirements

* An LRS MUST accept all Statements where their version starts with `1.0.` if they otherwise validate.
* An LRS MUST reject all Statements with a version specified that does not start with `1.0.`.
* Statements returned by an LRS MUST retain the version they are accepted with. If they
lack a version, the version MUST be set to `1.0.0`.


###### Learning Record Provider Requirements

* If Learning Record Providers set the Statement version, they MUST set it to `1.0.0`.
* Learning Record Providers SHOULD NOT set the Statement version.

__Note:__ The requirement for the "version" property to contain the value `1.0.0`, rather than the latest
patch version is deliberate since Statements in any version of 1.0.x conform to the 1.0.0 data model. In fact, 
a single Statement may be included in multiple requests over time, each following a different patch version 
of the specification. The patch version of the specification being followed can be determined from the 
["X-Experience-API-Version" header](./xAPI-Communication.md#33-versioning) being used in each request. 

#### 2.4.11 Attachments

###### Rationale

In some cases an Attachment is logically an important part of a Learning Record. It could be an essay, a video, etc. 
Another example of such an Attachment is (the image of) a certificate that was granted as a result of an experience. 
It is useful to have a way to store these Attachments in and retrieve them from an LRS. 

###### Details

The table below lists all properties of the Attachment Object.

<table>
	<tr><th>Property</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Required</th><th>Corresponding request parameter</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td><a name="attachmentUsage"></a>usageType</td>
		<td>IRI</td>
		<td>Identifies the usage of this Attachment. For example: one expected use case
		for Attachments is to include a "completion certificate". An IRI corresponding
		to this usage MUST be coined, and used with completion certificate attachments.</td>
		<td>Required</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>display</td>
		<td><a href="#42-language-maps">Language Map</a></td>
		<td>Display name (title) of this Attachment.</td>
		<td>Required</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>description</td>
		<td><a href="#42-language-maps">Language Map</a></td>
		<td>A description of the Attachment</td>
		<td>Optional</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>contentType</td>
		<td><a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2046.txt?number=2046">Internet Media Type</a></td>
		<td>The content type of the Attachment.</td>
		<td>Required</td>
		<td>Content-Type</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>length</td>
		<td>Integer</td>
		<td>The length of the Attachment data in octets.</td>
		<td>Required</td>
		<td>Content-Length</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>sha2</td>
		<td>String</td>
		<td>The SHA-2 hash of the Attachment data. <br/>
		This property is always required, even if fileURL is also specified. 
		</td>
		<td>Required</td>
		<td>X-Experience-API-Hash</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>fileUrl</td>
		<td>IRL</td>
		<td>An IRL at which the Attachment data can be retrieved, or from which it used 
		to be retrievable. </td>
        <td>Optional</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

In the case of wanting to include an Attachment(s) for a SubStatement, it is strongly recommended to include the 
Attachment(s) in the Statement's Attachment object and to include the payloads as normally done for a Statement.

### 2.5 Retrieval of Statements

###### Description

A collection of Statements can be retrieved by performing a query on the Statement 
Resource, see [Statement Resource](./xAPI-Communication.md#21-statement-resource) for details. 

###### Details

The following table shows the data structure for the results of queries on the Statement Resource.
<table>
	<tr><th>Property</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Required</th></tr>
	<tr><td>statements</td><td>Array of Statements</td>
		<td>List of Statements. If the list returned has been limited (due to pagination), 
			and there are more results, they will be located at the "statements" property 
			within the container located at the IRL provided by the "more" property of 
			this Statement result Object.
			Where no matching Statements are found, this property will contain an empty array.
		</td>
		<td>Required</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>more</td><td>IRL</td>
		<td>Relative IRL that can be used to fetch more results, including the full path 
			and optionally a query string but excluding scheme, host, and port. 
			Empty string if there are no more results to fetch.
		</td>
		<td>Required if the list returned has been limited, otherwise optional.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

###### Requirements

* The IRL retrieved from the "more" property MUST be usable for at least 24 hours after it is returned 
by the LRS. 
* An LRS MAY include all necessary information within the "more" property IRL to continue the query 
to avoid the need to store IRLs and associated query data.
* An LRS SHOULD NOT generate extremely long IRLs within the "more" property.
* An LRS MAY re-run the query at the point in time that the IRL retrieved from the "more" property 
is accessed such that the batch retrieved includes Statements which would have been included in that batch if present in the 
LRS at the time the original query was run and excludes Statements from that batch which have since been voided. 
* Alternatively, an LRS MAY cache a list of Statements to be returned at the "more" property such that 
the batch of Statements returned matches those Statements that would have been returned when the original query was run. 
* An LRS MAY remove voided Statements from the cached list of Statements if using this method. 
* A Learning Record Consumer SHOULD NOT attempt to interpret any meaning from the IRL returned from the 
"more" property.

### 2.6 Signed Statements

##### Description

A Statement can include a [digital signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) 
to provide strong and durable evidence of the authenticity and integrity of the Statement.

##### Rationale

Some Statements will have regulatory or legal significance, or otherwise require strong
and durable evidence of their authenticity and integrity. It might be necessary to verify
these Statements without trusting the environment they were first recorded in, or perhaps
without access to that environment. Digital signatures will enable a third-party to validate such Statements.

##### Details

Signed Statements include a JSON web signature (JWS) as an Attachment. This allows
the original serialization of the Statement to be included along with the signature.
For interoperability, the "RSA + SHA" series of JWS algorithms have been selected, and
for discoverability of the signer X.509 certificates SHOULD be used.

##### Signature Requirements
* A Signed Statement MUST include a JSON web signature (JWS) as defined here:
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515, as an Attachment with a usageType
of `http://adlnet.gov/expapi/attachments/signature` and a contentType of `application/octet-stream`.
* JWS Compact Serialization SHOULD* be used to create the JSON web signature. Use of JWS 
JSON Serialization is strongly discouraged, is unlikely to be interoperble with other systems, and will be forbidden 
in a future version of this specification. 
* The JWS signature MUST have a payload of a valid JSON serialization of the complete Statement 
before the signature was added.
* The JWS signature MUST use an algorithm of "RS256", "RS384", or "RS512".
* The JWS signature SHOULD have been created based on the private key associated with an
X.509 certificate.
* If X.509 was used to sign, the JWS header SHOULD include the "x5c" property containing
the associated certificate chain.

##### LRS Requirements
* The LRS MUST reject requests to store Statements that contain malformed signatures, with `400 Bad Request`.
* The LRS SHOULD include a message in the response of a rejected statement. 
* In order to verify signatures are well formed, the LRS MUST do the following:
    * Decode the JWS signature, and load the signed serialization of the Statement from the
      JWS signature payload.
    * Validate that the original Statement is logically equivalent to the received Statement. 
    See [Statement comparision requirements](#statement-comparision-requirements).
    * If the JWS header includes an X.509 certificate, validate the signature against that
    certificate as defined in JWS.
    * Validate that the signature requirements outlined above have been met. 

__Note:__ The step of validating against the included X.509 certificate is intended as a
way to catch mistakes in the signature, not as a security measure. The steps to authenticate
a signed Statement will vary based on the degree of certainty required and are outside
the scope of this specification.

##### Client Requirements

* Clients MUST follow the signature requirements outlined above.
* Clients MUST NOT assume a signature is valid simply because an LRS has accepted it.

##### Example

See [Appendix D: Example Signed Statement](#appendix-d-example-signed-statement) for an example.


## 3.0 Metadata

Metadata is additional information about the resource. It enables decision making, search, and discoverability. 
In xAPI, metadata can be utilized in a variety of locations. The most common is within [Activity Definitions](#activity-definition).


### 3.1 IRI Requirements

xAPI uses IRIs for identifiers. Using IRIs ensures uniqueness and promotes resolvability. The LRS and Learning Record 
Provider each have responsibilities in regard to each IRI as outlined below. Activity Definitions have additional rules 
which can be found [here](#activity-definition).

##### Metadata Provider Requirements

These requirements also apply to Learning Record Providers defining new IRIs. 

* [Metadata Providers](./xAPI-About.md#def-metadata-provider) defining new IRIs SHOULD* only use IRIs they control 
or have permission from the controller to use.
* Metadata Providers defining new Verb IRIs MUST only use IRIs they control 
or have permission from the controller to use.
* Where a suitable identifier already exists, the Metadata Provider SHOULD use the corresponding 
existing identifier and SHOULD NOT create a new identifier.
* When re-using an existing identifier, Metadata Providers SHOULD* ensure that the exact character 
equivelent IRI is used. 
* The Metadata Provider MAY create their own identifiers where a suitable identifier does not already exist.
* When defining identifiers, the Metadata Provider MAY use IRIs containing anchors so that a single 
page can contain definitions for multiple identifiers. E.g. `http://example.com/xapi/verbs#defenestrated`
* When defining identifiers, the Metadata Provider SHOULD use lowercase IRIs. 

##### LRS Requirements

* When storing or comparing IRIs, LRSs SHOULD* handle them only by using one or more of the approaches 
described in [5.3.1 (Simple String Comparison) and 5.3.2 (Syntax-Based Normalization) of RFC 3987](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987#section-5.3), and 
SHOULD* NOT handle them using any approaches described in [5.3.3 (Scheme-Based Normalization) or 5.3.4 (Protocol-Based Normalization) of the same RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987#section-5.3), 
or any other approaches.
* LRSs SHOULD* apply the same IRI comparison and normalization rules with all IRIs in parameters and 
fields defined to contain IRIs.


### 3.2 Hosted Metadata

##### Description

Additional information about an identifier can be provided within a Statement and can 
be hosted at the location pointed to by the identifier IRI. Including metadata in a Statement
allows metadata about the IRI to be expressed without the necessity of resolving it. Hosting
metadata at the IRI location allows the owner of the IRI to define the canonical metadata for
that IRI. 

##### Details

There are several types of IRI identifiers used in this specification:

* [Verb](#243-verb)
* [Activity id](#activity-id-requirements)
* [Activity type](#acttype)
* [extension key](#41-extensions)
* [attachment usage type](#attachmentUsage)

For the structure of hosted metadata about Activity ids, see [Activity Definition Object](#2441-when-the-objecttype-is-activity).

For the structure of hosted metadata about all other identifiers, see the format below:

<table>
	<tr><th>Property</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Required</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>name</td>
		<td><a href="#42-language-maps">Language Map</a></td>
		<td>The human readable/visual name. For Verbs, this is equivalent to the "display" property in a Statement.</td>
		<td>Optional</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>description</td>
		<td><a href="#42-language-maps">Language Map</a></td>
		<td>description</td>
		<td>Optional</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Hosted metadata consists of a document containing a JSON object as described above. If this hosted metadata is provided, 
it is the canonical source of information about the identifier it describes. It is recommended that those implementing xAPI
look for and use established, widely adopted identifiers for all types of IRI identifiers other than Activity id.

##### Metadata Provider Requirements

* Metadata MAY be provided with an identifier.
* If metadata is provided, both "name" and "description" SHOULD be included.
* For any of the identifier IRIs above the Metadata Provider SHOULD make a human-readable description of the 
intended usage accessible at the IRI.
* For any of the identifier IRIs above the Metadata Provider SHOULD ensure that this JSON metadata 
available at that IRI when the IRI is requested and a Content-Type of `application/json` is requested.
* Where the IRI represents an Activity, the Metadata Provider MAY host metadata using 
the [Activity Definition](#activity-definition) JSON format which is used in Statements, with a Content-Type of `application/json`.

##### LRS Requirements

* The LRS MAY act as a [Metadata Consumer](./xAPI-About.md#def-metadata-consumer) and attempt to resolve identifier IRIs.
* If an Activity IRI is a URL, an LRS SHOULD attempt to GET that URL, and include in HTTP
headers: `Accept: application/json, */*`. This SHOULD be done as soon as practical after the LRS
first encounters the Activity id.
* Upon loading JSON which is a valid Activity Definition from a URL used as an Activity id,
 an LRS SHOULD incorporate the loaded definition into its canonical definition for that Activity,
while preserving names or definitions not included in the loaded definition.
* Upon loading any document from which the LRS can parse an Activity Definition
from a URL used as an Activity id, an LRS MAY consider this definition when determining
its canonical representation of that Activity's definition.

##### Metadata Consumer Requirements

* If a Metadata Consumer obtains metadata from an IRI, it SHOULD make a strong presumption that the 
metadata found at that IRI is authoritative in regards to the properties and languages included in that metadata. 
* The Metadata Consumer MAY use other sources of information to fill in missing details, 
such as translations, or take the place of the hosted metadata entirely if it was not provided, cannot be loaded or the 
Metadata Consumer does not trust it. Other sources of information MAY include metadata in other formats stored at the 
IRI of an identifier, particularly if that identifier was not coined for use with this specification.



## 4.0 Special Data Types and Rules

The following are data types requiring additional rules that are found commonly in this specification.


### 4.1 Extensions

##### Description

Extensions are available as part of Activity Definitions, as part of a Statement's "context" property, or as part of a 
Statement's "result" property. In each case, extensions are intended to provide a natural way to extend those properties 
for some specialized use. The contents of these extensions might be something valuable to just one application, or it might 
be a convention used by an entire Community of Practice.

##### Details

Extensions are defined by a map and logically relate to the part of the Statement where they are present. The values of an 
extension can be any JSON value or data structure. Extensions in the "context" property provide context to the core experience, 
while those in the "result" property provide elements related to some outcome. Within Activities, extensions provide additional 
information that helps define an Activity within some custom application or Community of Practice. The meaning and structure of 
extension values under an IRI key are defined by the person who controls the IRI.

##### Requirements

* The keys of an extensions map MUST be IRIs.
* An LRS MUST NOT reject a Statement based on the values of the extensions map.
* Learning Record Providers SHOULD always strive to map as much information as possible into the built-in 
elements in order to leverage interoperability among Experience API conformant tools.
* All extension IRIs SHOULD have controllers.
* The controller of an IRL extension key SHOULD make a human-readable description of the intended meaning of 
the extension supported by the IRL accessible at the IRL.

__Note:__ A Statement defined entirely by its extensions becomes meaningless as no other system can make sense of it. 


### 4.2 Language Maps

##### Description

A language map is a dictionary where the key is a [RFC 5646 Language Tag](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646), and the 
value is a string in the language specified in the tag. This map SHOULD be populated as fully as possible based on the 
knowledge of the string in question in different languages. 

The shortest valid language code for each language string is generally preferred. The 
[ISO 639 language code](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) plus an 
[ISO 3166-1 country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) allows for the designation of
basic languages (e.g., `es` for Spanish) and regions (e.g.,
`es-MX`, the dialect of Spanish spoken in Mexico). If only the ISO 639 language code is known for certain, 
do not guess at the possible ISO 3166-1 country code. For example, if
only the primary language is known (e.g., English) then use the top level
language tag `en`, rather than `en-US`. If the specific regional variation is known, then use the full language code.

__Note:__ For Chinese languages, the significant linguistic diversity represented by `zh` means that the ISO 639 language 
code is generally insufficient.

The content of strings within a language map is plain text. It is expected that any formatting code 
such as HTML tags or markdown will not be rendered, but will be displayed as code when this string is 
displayed to an end user. An important exception to this is if language map Object is used in an extension and 
the owner of that extension IRI explicitly states that a particular form of code will be rendered.


### 4.3 IRIs

Internationalized Resource Identifiers, or IRIs, are unique identifiers which could also be resolvable. Because 
resolving is not a requirement, IRIs/URIs are used instead of IRLs/URLs. In order to allow the greatest flexibility 
in the characters used in an identifier, IRIs are used instead of URIs as IRIs can contain some characters outside 
of the ASCII character set. 

See [Metadata](#30-metadata). 


### 4.4 UUIDs

Universally Unique Identifiers, or UUIDs, are 128-bit values that are globally unique. Unlike IRIs, there is 
no expectation of resolvability as UUIDs take on a completely different format.  UUIDs MUST be in the standard 
string form.  It is recommended variant 2 in [RFC 4122](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) is used.


### 4.5 ISO 8601 Timestamps

Timestamps are a format type which represent a specific time. They are formatted according to ISO 8601's normal format. 
Statements sent to an LRS can be expected to keep precision to at least milliseconds 

###### Requirements
* A Timestamp MUST be formatted according to [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations).
* A Timestamp SHOULD* be expressed using the format described in [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt), which is a profile of ISO 8601. 
* A Timestamp MUST preserve precision to at least milliseconds (3 decimal points beyond seconds).  
* A Timestamp SHOULD* include the time zone.
* If the Timestamp includes a time zone, the LRS MAY be return the Timestamp using a different 
timezone to the one originally used in the Statement so long as the point in time referenced is not affected. 
* The LRS SHOULD* return the Timestamp in UTC timezone. 
* A Timestamp MAY be truncated or rounded to a precision of at least 3 decimal digits for seconds. 


### 4.6 ISO 8601 Durations

Durations are strings representing the amount of time something took.

###### Requirements

* A Duration MUST be expressed using the format for Duration in ISO 8601:2004(E) section 4.4.3.2.
The alternative format (in conformity with the format used for time points and described in ISO 8601:2004(E) 
section 4.4.3.3) MUST NOT be used.
* Learning Record Providers SHOULD provide a maximum precision of 0.01 seconds. 
* Learning Record Providers MAY provide less precision, for example in the case of reading a 
University Degree precision might be in months or years. 
* On receiving a Duration with more than 0.01 second precision, the LRS SHOULD* NOT reject the 
request but MAY truncate the "duration" property to 0.01 second precision. 
* When comparing Durations, any precision beyond 0.01 second precision SHOULD* NOT be included 
in the comparison.

###### Examples

The table below provides some example ISO 8601 Durations. This list is not intended to be exhaustive. 

<table>
	<tr><th>Example</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>PT4H35M59.14S</td>
		<td>Four hours, thirty five minutes and 59.14 seconds.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>PT16559.14S</td>
		<td>The same time period as above represented in seconds. 
		(Note: if the time period in question contained a leap second, this conversion would be inaccurate)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>P3Y1M29DT4H35M59.14S</td>
		<td>A Duration also including years, months and days.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>P3Y</td>
		<td>Approximately three years e.g. completion of a qualification.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>P4W</td>
		<td>Four weeks. Note that weeks cannot be combined with other time periods. 'P4W1D' is not valid.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Durations are expected to be presented in the format in which they are recorded. For example if a Duration is tracked
in seconds (or fractions of a second) there is no need to convert this to hours, minutes, and seconds.

            "objectType": "Agent"
        }
    ]
}
```


###### Object is Statement

This example shows a SubStatement Object whose Object is a Statement Reference.

```
{
    "objectType": "SubStatement",
    "actor" : {
        "objectType": "Agent", 
        "mbox":"mailto:agent@example.com"
