xAPI-Spec
=========

This Github repository contains the xAPI Specification. xAPI is a learning technologies interoperbility specification that describes communication 
about learner activity and experiences between technologies. You can [read the latest release of the specification here](xAPI.md).  The group meets the first, second, and third Wednesdays of each month on GoToWebinar.  You can register [at https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/279276321478091778](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/279276321478091778)

## Specification versions
The current version of the specification is [1.0.2](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI.md). 
[1.0.3](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/1.0.3/xAPI.md) is currently being developed by
the specification working group. 

##What to do if the spec is unclear
If when implementing the specification you find something is unclear or unhelpful, it may be that the others have similarly found that
section unclear and that it has been fixed in the 
[development version of the specification (1.0.3)](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/1.0.3/xAPI.md) which is being developed by the 
xAPI Working Group. You can and should look at the development version of the specification for reference, but be aware that this version has
not been published, could contain errors and might be changed before it is released. 

If your confusions and concerns have not been addressed in the [development version)](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/1.0.3/xAPI.md), 
you can help to improve the specification by [raising an issue here](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/issues). When raising an issue, 
please give as much detail as you can in regards to:

* Which part/parts of the specification you are reading.
* Your understanding of what these parts mean.
* The product and feature you are implmenting xAPI in; what's the use case you are trying to achieve?
* How you would like the specification to be improved. Suggest some specific new wording if you like!
