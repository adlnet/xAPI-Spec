# xAPI-Spec

This Github repository contains the xAPI Specification. xAPI is a learning
technologies interoperability specification that describes communication
about learner activity and experiences between technologies. The specification is
divided into three documents:

*   Part One:   [About the Experience API](./xAPI-About.md#partone)
*   Part Two:   [Experience API Data](./xAPI-Data.md#parttwo)
*   Part Three: [Data Processing, Validation, and Security](./xAPI-Communication.md#partthree)

## Specification versions

The current version of the specification is
[1.0.3](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/).

The next version of the specification has not been planned. 

## What to do if the spec is unclear

If when implementing the specification you find something is unclear or
unhelpful, you can help to improve the specification by
[raising an issue here](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/issues). When
raising an issue, please give as much detail as you can in regards to:

* Which part/parts of the specification you are reading.
* Your understanding of what these parts mean.
* The product and feature you are implementing xAPI in; what's the use case you
  are trying to achieve?
* How you would like the specification to be improved. Suggest some specific new
  wording if you like!
